qfm002,keepyourlawsoffmybody_flyer.jpg,Keep Your Laws Off My Body flyer,image/jpeg,"Andrew Wood is a graphic designer and gay activist. Born in Atlanta in 1962, the son of two doctors, Wood's early years were filled with art, books, and culture. He attended public schools in Dekalb County and worked in public radio. In 1980, Wood moved to San Francisco for art school and to join the thriving gay organization, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. This charitable group of gay men dressed in nuns habits performed activism and street theater informed with the pagan spirituality of the Radical Faerie movement. While in San Francisco, Wood experienced the AIDS epidemic which caused him to return to Atlanta. After the Democratic National Convention in 1988, he and a handful of fellow protesters started an Atlanta Chapter of ACT/UP. ACT/UP practiced aggressive tactics, civil disobedience, and direct action to bring attention to the plight of AIDS sufferers. Wood moved to New Orleans in 1990 and stayed there until 2004 when he returned to Atlanta to care for his elderly mother.
