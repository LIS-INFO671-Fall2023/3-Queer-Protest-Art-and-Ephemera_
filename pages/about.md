## About the Collection

“Read My Lips: Queer Protest Art and Ephemera” is a digital archive collection centered around protest art and ephemera in the context of post-Stonewall LGBTQ+ movements across the United States. This project aims to bring together materials from all over the United States to highlight the rich and multifaceted history of LGBTQ+ activism. The collection has a particular focus on gay and queer liberation movements and AIDS activism through the 1980’s and 1990’s. 

Items were selected from the Digital Public Library of America’s collections which included items from the Gran Fury Collection from NYPL, the Safe Harbor/Aids Collection, and ONE National Archives. The collection features a wide range of media types such as posters, pamphlets, banners, t-shirts, buttons, and pins to show the various forms protest and celebration have taken in the LGBTQ+ community throughout history. Items in the collection were chosen based on the following themes:

* Post-Stonewall Gay and Queer Liberation movements and protests
* AIDS activism and the role of organizations such as ACT UP
* The history of the LGBTQ+ community in the United States
* Pride and celebration
  

The anticipated user groups of this collection would include researchers interested in queer history, protest, feminism, and the AIDS crisis. The collection could also be used as a teaching tool for relevant college courses. Another potential user group would be queer community members interested in learning about historic events related to their own affinity groups. 


### Some Historical Context and Background

Starting in the 1980s, several artist groups, collectives, and other political groups were founded in response to the lack of government intervention in the AIDS epidemic. Many protestors engaged in direct action tactics such as phone zaps, fax zaps, sit-ins in government offices, vigils, die-ins, kiss-ins, marches and demonstrations, and wheat pasting posters in public spaces. Agitprop art was made to provoke the public and as a call to action.

One artist collective in particular, Gran Fury, comprised of members, Richard Elovich, Avram Finkelstein, Amy Heard, Tom Kalin, John Lindell, Loring McAlpin, Marlene McCarty, Donald Moffett, Michael Nesline, Mark Simpson, and Robert Vazquez-Pacheco, designed a lot of agitprop art for ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). ACT UP was formed in 1987 as an international, grassroots, horizontal activist group that still has active chapters across the US today. Other groups active in cultural production and protest around AIDS include Lesbian Avengers, Fierce Pussy, and Queer Nation. 

This collection draws attention to the diffuse coalitional nature of various direct action anti-AIDS movements and the use of camp and humor in protest which highlights how the political, emotional, and cultural dimensions of protest are linked together. Queer feminist protest ephemera extends beyond AIDS activism to contemporary movements for queer liberation, trans rights, and more.  This collection focuses on cultural production, that is objects such as ephemera, events such as protest, and spaces such as archives, memorials, and museums that occur external to science and government.
