## About the Collection

“Read My Lips: Queer Protest Art and Ephemera” is a digital archive collection centered around protest art and ephemera in the context of post-Stonewall LGBTQ+ movements across the United States. This project aims to bring together materials from all over the United States to highlight the rich and multifaceted history of LGBTQ+ activism. The collection has a particular focus on gay and queer liberation movements and AIDS activism through the 1980’s and 1990’s and includes items from the Digital Public Library of America’s collections such as the Gran Fury Collection from NYPL, Safe Harbor/Aids Collection, and ONE National Archives.
