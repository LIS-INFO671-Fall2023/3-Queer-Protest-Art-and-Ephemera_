## About the Collection

“Read My Lips: Queer Protest Art and Ephemera” is a digital archive collection centered around protest art and ephemera in the context of post-Stonewall LGBTQ+ movements across the United States. This project aims to bring together materials from all over the United States to highlight the rich and multifaceted history of LGBTQ+ activism. The collection has a particular focus on gay and queer liberation movements and AIDS activism through the 1980’s and 1990’s. Items were selected from the Digital Public Library of America’s collections which included items from the Gran Fury Collection from NYPL, the Safe Harbor/Aids Collection, and ONE National Archives. The collection features a wide range of media types such as posters, pamphlets, banners, t-shirts, buttons, and pins to show the various forms protest and celebration have taken in the LGBTQ+ community throughout history.

Items in the collection were chosen based on the following themes:
* Post-Stonewall Gay and Queer Liberation movements and protests
* AIDS activism and the role of organizations such as ACT UP
* The history of the LGBTQ+ community in the United States
* Pride and celebration

The anticipated user groups of this collection would include researchers interested in queer history, protest, feminism, and the AIDS crisis. The collection could also be used as a teaching tool for relevant college courses. Another potential user group would be queer community members interested in learning about historic events related to their own affinity groups.
